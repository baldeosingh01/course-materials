# CMPSC 100 M1 Course Contract

## A word from the instructor

> In most learning situations in life outside of school, grades are never given.
The learning that occurs in Kung Fu dojos, or cooking, dance, or yoga studios
do not use any grading. Why? In these “studio” cases, it seems meaningless to
give students grades, and yet without any grades, those students get better at
yoga, dance, and cooking.

> Asao Inoue, "160W's Grading Contract"

Nearly everything you've done during your time at various learning institutions has resolved to single point: the final grade. Whether this was a quarterly, annual, or semi-annual grade (i.e. semester grade), your education has formatted you towards achieving the best letter grade outcome possible. That's not (mostly) how this course goes, however.

I recognize there as many reasons for taking this particular course as there are students enrolled in it. There exist an equal number of hesitancies and anxieties about this course as well. Some of you look forward to doing things simply because they are hard. Others of you may have enrolled in this class because it seems advantageous to develop skills tangent to computer science. Others may be interested in majoring in the discipline at Allegheny. 

One thing is likely common to all of you: you're at least a little afraid that this course will be difficult and that difficulty will manifest itself in a poor grade.

This statement is meant to allay that fear. I write above that this course will "mostly" not be contingent on the above thought. In fact, I want you to exile the idea of grading from your foremost thoughts. The idea of failure often precludes us from taking risks for fear that we'll look (or even worse) feel inferior or, at worst, incapable of understanding a concept.

In this course, we will rely on a course contract to determine what kinds of behaviors lead to learning vis-a-vis a computer science environment. We will spend the opening class sessions of this course working together to identify and codify those things that we will hold ourselves and others accountable to. In fact, this class relies on more than just a sense of community to function: it relies on actual community rules and efforts. I include myself as part of this course community, so this contract also indemnifies _me_ to uphold the behaviors and expectations written into it.

This module -- at least up to the point where the college requires that I assign you an individual letter grade -- is also _ungraded_, meaning you will never see an actual letter grade from me on an assignment. Instead, I will provide formative feedback rather than mere evaluation. Does that mean you can't get anything _wrong_? No, of course not. You'll still have plenty of opportunity and encouragement to fail. All this means is that `failure != "F"`. (If you can read that last "equation," you've figured out some computational already.) The only thing that leads to failure here is inauthentic effort.

At the end of the module, I have to give you a grade. But, following this contract should take care of that.

So what _does_ this mean? Perhaps it's important to identify what it _doesn't mean_: this course is not one where you will be able to just "get by." In fact, ungraded contract courses, historically, require _more_ work than graded ones. However, you are rewarded for completing work to a satisfactory degree, a statement which we will use this contract to clarify.

Here, you are rewarded for the quality of your honest effort. Not everyone in computer science "got it" right away. I'm sure that your Technical Leaders (TLs) and even department faculty (including me) would tell you that. However, if you participate in this discipline, you'll learn that you're really developing a _practice_ -- a work that presages attempt, failure, _and_ success all at once -- in learning how to compute both efficiently _and_ meaningfully.

I look forward to establishing the bounaries of the map of this journey with you.

## Contract stipulations

### The "Basic Rule"

* All students who meet the covenants of this contract will earn an individual letter grade of `B` in this course

#### Grades higher than the Basic Grade

The instructor reserves the right to award particuarly accomplished work a `+` mark, indicating excellent or advanced implementations of work.

##### `A` grades

###### `A+` grade

* A student who:
   * Completes all assignments in full and on time
   * Has `2` or more `+` marks awarded per week (excepting the course project)
   
will receive an `A` in the course.

###### `A-` grade

* A student who:
   * Completes all assignments in full and on time
   * Has `1` or more `+` marks awarded per week (excepting the course project)
   
will receive an `A` in the course.

##### `B+` grade

* A student who:
   * Completes all assignments in full and on time
   * Has `1` or more `+` marks awarded across _all weeks_
   
will receive a `B+` in the course.

#### Grades lower than the Basic Grade

Violating contract provisions below will result in grade penalties specified in each section.

### The "Rules Rule"

* Convenants in this contract may be changed following an open course discussion about the proposed change(s)
* Any changes will then be put to a vote. If a vote succeeds with a majority (50% + 1) outcome supporting the measure(s) proposed, the change will be made
  * This applies to all portions of the contract _except_ for the "Basic Rule" and this rule
  * In addition, the professor reserves the right to veto a proposed change if it demonstrably undermines the academic integrity of the course or is superceded by policies within the college's academic standards or handbook

### Participation

`TODO: Determine constituents of "participation"`

#### Course platforms

`TODO: Determine etiquette of course platforms`

#### Using office hours

`TODO: Establish best practices for using office hours`

#### Attendance

All students are expected to attend a majority of sessions in the course. However, in reality, we understand that situations arise which make attendance impossible. Especially given the ongoing global pandemic, it is impossible to assert that "perfect attendance" be our metric. With this context in mind:

* Course members are expected to attend all course sessions unless the instructor is otherwise notified
  * Students missing more than `2` sessions over the course of the module will have their contract-based letter grade reduced by _half_ a letter grade for every absence beyond the `2`nd.
* The instructor may also cancel class sessions given that proper notice is given via Discord channel message

### Assignments

* Assignments will be given for the week during the first course session of the week
* Assignments will be due on the following Sunday at 11:59p

#### Missing assignments

In this course there are two types of missing assignments:

1. Weekly assignment repositories submitted missing entire days of work ("Missing" assignments)
2. Entire weekly assignment repositories not submitted ("Ignored" assignments)

##### "Missing" assignments

* Any "Missing" assignments will count for half a letter grade against a student's final course grade

##### "Ignored" assignments

* Any "Ignored" assignments automatically constitute a failing grade in the course

#### Grading

* Assignments will be graded on a _completion_ basis
  * Here, "completion" means:
    * Submission is made on or before due date/time
    * Submission features working code and/or complete documentation
    * At least 90% of all grading "checks" satisfied
* Turning in _incomplete_ work will result in a student earning 90% of possible assignment points _multiplied by_ the amount of checks completed
   * "Incomplete" should be taken to mean:
     * Su
* In the event that there are "bugs" with grader criteria, the instructor will assess completion status based on known issues
  * the instructor will make every effort to remedy the failiing check before the assignment due date
  * e.g. if, during assignment evaluation, a check fails for every student due to a technical issue, the check is considered an invalid grading criteria
  
### Group Contribution

This course works due to the trust the instructor places in each team becoming a collaborative home for all students. However, there is a fine line between collaboration and academic dishonesty.

#### Groupwork assignments

#### Teamwork assignments

### The "Gimme"



### Exceptions to the contract
