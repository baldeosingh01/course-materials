# CMPSC 100 M1 Course Contract

## A word from the instructor

> In most learning situations in life outside of school, grades are never given.
The learning that occurs in Kung Fu dojos, or cooking, dance, or yoga studios
do not use any grading. Why? In these “studio” cases, it seems meaningless to
give students grades, and yet without any grades, those students get better at
yoga, dance, and cooking.

> Asao Inoue, "160W's Grading Contract"

(Computer science has more in common with things like cooking or dance than you might think.)

Nearly everything you've done during your time at various learning institutions has resolved to single point: the final grade. Whether this was a quarterly, annual, or semi-annual grade (i.e. semester grade), your education has formatted you towards achieving the best letter grade outcome possible. That's not (mostly) how this course goes, however.

I recognize there as many reasons for taking this particular course as there are students enrolled in it. There exist an equal number of hesitancies and anxieties about this course as well. Some of you look forward to doing things simply because they are hard. Others of you may have enrolled in this class because it seems advantageous to develop skills tangent to computer science. Others may be interested in majoring in the discipline at Allegheny. 

One thing is likely common to all of you: you're at least somewhat afraid that this course will be difficult and that this difficulty will manifest itself in a poor grade.

This introduction is meant to allay that fear. I write above that this course will "mostly" not be contingent on grades. In fact, I want you to exile the idea of grading from your brain completely. The idea of failure often precludes us from taking risks for fear that we'll look or feel inferior or, at worst, be incapable of understanding a concept. Unfortunately, the inevitability of letter grades often amplifies that fear, as it's a very real consequence.

But this course is less about "making the grade" than it is giving you mental and computational skills and tools to conquer problems. In this way, I hope that you'll take less about the physical machinery of computers from this class and more of the -- dare I say "spiritual" -- exercise of approaching problem solving with new computational powers and applying ways of thinking to at least formulate ways to solve abstract quandries.

In fact, I care more about your excitement and confidence with the material than I do about grades. Grades are the _worst_.

This module -- at least up to the point where the college requires that I assign you an individual letter grade -- is _ungraded_, meaning you will never see an actual letter grade from me on an assignment. Instead, I will provide formative feedback. Does that mean you can't get anything _wrong_? No, of course not. You'll still have plenty of opportunity and encouragement to fail. All this means is that `failure != "F"`. (If you can read that last "equation," you've figured out some computational already.) The only thing that leads to failure here is inauthentic effort.

At the end of the module, I have to give you a grade. But, following this contract should take care of that.

In this course, we will rely on a contract to determine what kinds of behaviors lead to learning vis-a-vis a computer science environment. We will spend the opening class sessions of this course working together to identify and codify those things that we will hold ourselves and others accountable to. In fact, this class relies on more than just a sense of community to function: it relies on actual community rules and efforts. I include myself as part of this course community, so this contract also indemnifies _me_ to uphold the behaviors and expectations written into it.

So what does all this mean? Perhaps it's important to identify what it _doesn't mean_: this course is not one where you will be able to just "get by." In fact, ungraded contract courses, historically, require _more_ work than graded ones. However, you are rewarded for completing work to a satisfactory degree, a statement which we will use this contract to clarify.

Here, you are rewarded for the quality of your honest work. Not everyone in computer science "got it" right away and I'm sure that your Technical Leaders (TLs) and even department faculty (including me) would tell you that. However, if you participate in this discipline, you'll learn that you're really developing a _practice_ -- a work that presages attempt, failure, _and_ success all at once -- in learning how to compute meaningfully. 

For all of you, the terrain of this journey will be tough in different ways. It's my sincere hope that spelling out the boundaries of the map will make it at least traversable.

## Contract stipulations

### The "Basic Grade"

* All students who meet the covenants of this contract will earn an individual letter grade of `B` in this course

#### Grades higher than the Basic Grade

Assignments which achieve `100%` of all checks completed by the deadline will be awarded a `+` mark. Based on the number of `+` marks awarded, the instructor may award students grades higher than the Basic Grade.

##### `A` grades

###### `A+` grade

* A student who:
   * Completes all assignments in full and on time
   * Has `2` or more `+` marks awarded per week (excepting the course project)
   
will receive an `A` in the course.

###### `A-` grade

* A student who:
   * Completes all assignments in full and on time
   * Has `1` or more `+` marks awarded per week (excepting the course project)
   
will receive an `A` in the course.

##### `B+` grade

* A student who:
   * Completes all assignments in full and on time
   * Has `1` or more `+` marks awarded across _all weeks_
   
will receive a `B+` in the course.

#### Grades lower than the Basic Grade

Violating contract provisions below will result in grade penalties specified in each section.

### The "Rules Rule"

* Convenants in this contract may be changed following an open course discussion about the proposed change(s)
* Any changes will then be put to a vote. If a vote succeeds with a majority (50% + 1) outcome supporting the measure(s) proposed, the change will be made
  * This applies to all portions of the contract _except_ for the "Basic Grade" and this rule ("Rules Rule")
  * In addition, the professor reserves the right to veto a proposed change if it demonstrably undermines the academic integrity of the course or is superceded by policies within the college's academic standards or handbook

### Participation

`TODO: Determine constituents of "participation"`

#### Course platforms

`TODO: Determine etiquette of course platforms`

#### Using office hours

`TODO: Establish best practices for using office hours`

#### Attendance

`TODO: Establish guidelines constituting "attendance"`

### Assignments

* Assignments will be given for the week during the first course session of the week
* Assignments will be due on the following Sunday at 11:59p
* Due to the brief nature of this course, the instructor will not accept late assignments
  * Here, "late" should mean that an assignment is submitted more than 12 hours after the deadline

#### Missing assignments

In this course there are two types of missing assignments:

1. Weekly assignment repositories submitted missing entire days of work ("Missing" assignments)
2. Entire weekly assignment repositories not submitted ("Ignored" assignments)

##### "Missing" assignments

* Any "Missing" assignments will count for half a letter grade against a student's final course grade

##### "Ignored" assignments

* Any "Ignored" assignments automatically constitute a failing grade in the course

#### Grading

##### Complete assignments

* Assignments will be graded on a _completion_ basis
  * Here, "completion" means:
    * Submission is made on or before due date/time
    * Submission features working code and/or complete documentation
      * Here, "working" should be taken to mean "run" -- it can still produce incorrect results, but must _run_
      * Documentation also encompasses reflective writing
    * At least 80% of all grading "checks" satisfied
    
##### Incomplete assignments

* Turning in _incomplete_ work will count as a ["Missing" assignment][#Missing-assignments]
   * "Incomplete" should be taken to mean:
     * Submission not made on or before due date/time
     * Submission does not feature "working" code and/or has incomplete documentation
       * Here, "does not feature 'working' code" indicates the programs _don't run_
       
##### Assignment bugs and impact on grading

* In the event that there are "bugs" with grader criteria, the instructor will assess completion status with known issues in mind
  * The instructor will make every effort to remedy the failiing check before the assignment due date
  * However, if during assignment evaluation, a check fails for every student due to a technical issue, the check is considered an invalid grading criteria

### Group Contribution

This course works due to the trust the instructor places in each team becoming a collaborative home for all students. However, there is a fine line between collaboration and academic dishonesty.

#### Groupwork assignments

`TODO: Codify contribution behavior for assignments which rely on collective group effort`

#### Teamwork/Collborative assignments

`TODO: Design rules for assignments with individual submission, but allowed collaboration/discussion`

### The "Repair Rule" (i.e. Assignment Revision)

This rule only applies to assignments classified as ["Missing" assignments](#Missing-assignments).

* _Once_ during the Module, a student may open an Issue using the `Repair` Issue Template on a repository to which they'd like to submit missing work to regain credit for an assignment
* This "Repair" issue must fill out the resulting form completely to request the ability to submit revisions
* Students submitting a revision must remedy deficiencies listed in the most recent "Checkpoint" issue
  * Credit will be awarded as "complete" or "incomplete" according to the guidelines outlined in the [Grading](#Grading) section above
* A student submitting a revision is allowed five (5) days to submit updated work
  * There is no limit on the number of `commit`s allowed during this time (i.e. students may `commit` as many times as they like)
