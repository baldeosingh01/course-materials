# CMPSC 100 M1 Course Contract

## A word from the instructor

> In most learning situations in life outside of school, grades are never given.
The learning that occurs in Kung Fu dojos, or cooking, dance, or yoga studios
do not use any grading. Why? In these “studio” cases, it seems meaningless to
give students grades, and yet without any grades, those students get better at
yoga, dance, and cooking.

> Asao Inoue, "160W's Grading Contract"

Nearly everything you've done during your time at various learning institutions has resolved to single point: the final grade. Whether this was a quarterly, annual, or semi-annual grade (i.e. semester grade), your education has formatted you towards achieving the best letter grade outcome possible. That's not (mostly) how this course goes, however.

I recognize there as many reasons for taking this particular course as there are students enrolled in it. There exist an equal number of hesitancies and anxieties about this course as well. Some of you look forward to doing things simply because they are hard. Others of you may have enrolled in this class because it seems advantageous to develop skills tangent to computer science. Others may be interested in majoring in the discipline at Allegheny. 

One thing is likely common to all of you: you're at least a little afraid that this course will be difficult and that difficulty will manifest itself in a poor grade.

This statement is meant to allay that fear. I write above that this course will "mostly" not be contingent on the above thought. In fact, I want you to exile the idea of grading from your foremost thoughts. The idea of failure often precludes us from taking risks for fear that we'll look (or even worse) feel inferior or, at worst, incapable of understanding a concept.

In this course, we will rely on a course contract to determine what kinds of behaviors lead to learning vis-a-vis a computer science environment. We will spend the opening class sessions of this course working together to identify and codify those things that we will hold ourselves and others accountable to. In fact, this class relies on more than just a sense of community to function: it relies on actual community rules and efforts. I include myself as part of this course community, so this contract also indemnifies _me_ to uphold the behaviors and expectations written into it.

This module -- at least up to the point where the college requires that I assign you an individual letter grade -- is also _ungraded_, meaning you will never see an actual letter grade from me on an assignment. Instead, I will provide formative feedback rather than mere evaluation. Does that mean you can't get anything _wrong_? No, of course not. You'll still have plenty of opportunity and encouragement to fail. All this means is that `failure != "F"`. (If you can read that last "equation," you've figured out some computational already.) The only thing that leads to failure here is inauthentic effort.

At the end of the module, I have to give you a grade. But, following this contract should take care of that.

So what _does_ this mean? Perhaps it's important to identify what it _doesn't mean_: this course is not one where you will be able to just "get by." In fact, ungraded contract courses, historically, require _more_ work than graded ones. However, you are rewarded for completing work to a satisfactory degree, a statement which we will use this contract to clarify.

Here, you are rewarded for the quality of your honest effort. Not everyone in computer science "got it" right away. I'm sure that your Technical Leaders (TLs) and even department faculty (including me) would tell you that. However, if you participate in this discipline, you'll learn that you're really developing a _practice_ -- a work that presages attempt, failure, _and_ success all at once -- in learning how to compute both efficiently _and_ meaningfully.

I look forward to establishing the bounaries of the map of this journey with you.
